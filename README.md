# Disenchant Champion Shards
This script disenchants all your champion shards if you already own the champion.

## Usage (EXE version)
1. Download the [exe](https://github.com/Anujan/disenchant-champ-shards/releases/download/1.0.0/disenchant.exe) and put it in your League of Legends folder. This has to be the folder that contains *LeagueClient.exe*
2. Open up your League Client
3. Start the program
4. ENJOY THE ~~IP~~ BLUE ESSENCE.

## Running the script
The script works as well, if you don't want the compiled exe. You'll need Ruby installed, and then just run the script with Ruby from the League Client folder.


## Restrictions
This only works on Windows. I don't have access to a macOS laptop so I can't test it. Feel free to make a PR with support for macOS :)
